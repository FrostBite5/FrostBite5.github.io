# console-error-game
A game about getting console errors.

Why hello! You've reached the household of Frostbite5. This is a game called Console Error Game. It's based partly off of Aarex's Universal Attractor (and by based off i mean it's based off of all the console errors i get in it). Has many Idle aspects, maybe some clicker later on, and a LOT of Deriative Clicker elements. Have fun, and I wish you farewell.
