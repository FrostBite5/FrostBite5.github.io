# Console Error Game: A Game by FrostBite5
A game about getting console errors.

Why hello! You've reached the household of Frostbite5. This is a game called Console Error Game. It's based partly off of Aarex's Universal Attractor (and by based off i mean it's based off of all the console errors i get in it), and Antimatter Dimensions (i.e. the different kinds of boosts). Has many Idle aspects, upgrades, and is an incremental.
Aarex, Username5243, Merp, and Slabdrill will be helping out on the project.

Also: Sorry about the N1 grind. everything should be fine pretty soon.

## Purpose of The Game

I designed this game for fun. I like doing JS, HTML, and a small amount of CSS, no matter how bad I may be.
