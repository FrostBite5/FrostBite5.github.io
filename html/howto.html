</div>
<h1>Computers</h1>
<div>Computers aren't a hard concept to grasp. Each computer produces the next power of 10 up. That would mean TI produces 1, TII produces 10, and so on. The errors earned from these computers can be use to buy more computers, higher tier computers, or upgrades.</div>
<h1>Production Boost</h1>
<div>Production boosts do exactly as they say. They are unlocked at your first TIII computer, and can be bought at 1e3 errors. It gives a 2x boost, unless you have a network (N1=2.5x, N2=3x, N3=3.5x, so on).</div>
<h1>Upgrade Computers</h1>
<div>Upgrade Computers is the first layer of pretige meant to make the game easier to progress. The first UC costs 10 TI computers, and the second costs 10 TII computers, and so on. Upgrade Computers gives a bonus of about 2x to the tier of computer you bought it with.</div>
<h1>I.P. Change</h1>
<div>I.P. Change is the second layer of prestige in this game. It is one of the most crucial prestiges in the game. I.P. Change costs 20 of your highest tier computers, and can only be bought when you have maxed UCs (instead of a UC button, it will say "Maxed out!"). This gains the next tier of computer. IP1 gives a Tier V computer, IP2 gives a Tier VI computer, and so on.</div>
<h1>Internet Boosts</h1>
<div>Internet Boosts replaces I.P. Changes after the fifth one. They can be bought for 35 TIX computers for the first one. It gives about a 2x boost to all computers.</div>
<h1>Networks</h1>
<div>Networks are the last prestige layer before the next one. They are the most critical prestiges, as it gives a fairly large boost to production boost. When v1 is released, it will give a 2.5x multiplier on N1, a 3x on N2, and so on. If you are playing the main branch upon time of writing (v0.5), it will give a .01x boost to Production Boost. The first one costs 80 TIX computers.
